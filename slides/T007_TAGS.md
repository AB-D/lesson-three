## Template Tags

* That's great if we had only one album instance but what if we want to show all of our albums. To do this we would use tags.
* Tags provide arbitrary logic in the rendering process.
* Meaning it could do the following:
    * Serve as a control structure for your template
    * Grab content from a database
    * A tag can output content
    * Enable access to other template
