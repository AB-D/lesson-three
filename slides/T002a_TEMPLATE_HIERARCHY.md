## Template Hierarchy

* The Django convention is to structure the template directory as follows:  

```
## Where our project name is `music` and our app name is `album`
    ├── music
    └── album
        └── templates
            ├── base.html
            └── album
                ├── album_list.html
                └── album_details.html
   
```
